				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
				</p>
				<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
				</p>
				<p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
					</li>
					<li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).

				<header>JavaScript and Java</header>
				<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
				<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

				<header>Data Types</header>
				<p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
				<p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
					<li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
					<li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
					<li>Numbers.</li>
					<li>Strings.</li>
					<li>Symbols. (new in ECMAScript 2015) 
							A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
					<li>and Objects</li>
